# Sat-Tracker
Software for the Satellite Tracker that is using servos

# Overview
This porject uses an ESP8266 CPU with built in wifi to control a 2 axis gimbal to follow satelites as they go across the sky.

This project was inspired by another project located here: http://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/AST/

I have made several large changes to the design but my concept and software are based on this original project.

# How It Works
The ESP8266 connects to a servo controller to control large robotic servos.  A GPS provides the current location and a Degrees of Freedom sensor provides feedback on the tilt and rotation as well as magnetic direction.

With all of the input from the different sensors, the system can track a satelite.
